# covid_data_exploration_sql
Project Overview
In this project, I imported the COVID-19 infection and vaccination dataset from the WHO (World Health Organization) website. The project involves transforming the data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Structured Query Language (SQL). The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into global trends related to COVID-19 cases and vaccination progress across countries.

Dataset
The dataset for this project was sourced from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard. It includes data on:
Daily and cumulative COVID-19 infection cases
Daily and cumulative vaccination numbers
Information broken down by country, region, and date

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
Import the dataset from the WHO website and transform it into a format suitable for analysis.
Use SQL to explore the dataset, extract trends, and answer key questions, such as:
How are infection rates progressing over time?
What is the correlation between vaccination rates and infection rates in different regions?
Which countries have the highest vaccination coverage?
Identify anomalies or spikes in infection and vaccination rates.
Gain insights into the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic using data.

Tools & Technologies
SQL: For querying and transforming the dataset
WHO COVID-19 Dataset: Sourced directly from the WHO
DBMS: Any relational database system supporting SQL (PostgreSQL)

Results
The exploratory data analysis provided the following insights:

Global Trends: Infection and vaccination rates over time.
Top Countries: Countries leading in vaccination coverage and those with high infection rates.
Correlations: Identified trends and potential correlations between vaccination and infection rates.
